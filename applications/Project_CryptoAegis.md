## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

**Crypto Aegis: Present and defend legitimate and favourable crypto and blockchain projects.**

As the crypto world enters a new bull market, it has to far been dominated by meme coin and by fraudulent projects on the Solana blockchain. Such projects are undermining the credibility of the crypto and blockchain ecosystems. We propose to help Polkadot in its positioning as the trusted blockchain for serious and credible projects.
We will do so by conducting ten professional due diligence on the 10 largest projects (by marketcap) that are exclusively on the Polkadot chain. These reports will then be distributed throughout our network and can also be distributed through your network. 

With Crypto Aegis' Due Diligence service, our experts detect any red flags regarding a project's team, company history, assets, legal aspects, finances and reputation. This service includes an in-depth analysis of the project's token or coin offering. You will then receive a detailed report that will enable you to make the necessary changes to bring the project up to an exemplary standard. Once these changes have been made, official certification is granted so that the project can prove and justify its claims to current and potential future stakeholders, including investors.

Our project will be an asset for Substrate, Polkadot and Kusama, as it will enable them to assess the reliability and security of projects that are grafted onto it. Finally, the certification provided by Crypto Aegis is designed to boost user confidence in the blockchain.

Our mission is to help Polkadot and the projects that are on its blockchain to be perceived by current and future investors as the blockchain of choices for credible, serious and reliable projects.

Some of our reports are available on our official website : https://cryptoaegis.io/

### The data collection and analysis procedures

The due diligence process begins with a comprehensive data collection phase, which involves gathering information from multiple sources. This includes reviewing public documents such as court documents and financial records, analysing third-party reports from financial analysts and legal advisors, and reviewing media coverage and social media discussions about the project.

Once the data has been collected, an in-depth analysis is carried out to check the accuracy and reliability of the information. Background checks are carried out on team members to confirm their educational and professional qualifications and to check for any criminal records. Legal compliance is assessed by examining registration documents and certificates of compliance, and checking that there are no legal disputes or financial problems. Asset verification ensures that the project's physical and digital assets are legitimate and properly accounted for. Financial analysis includes reviewing audited financial statements, assessing revenue streams, funding sources and investor credibility. Finally, reputation assessment includes analysis of community feedback, incident history and overall market perception to provide a comprehensive assessment of the project's viability and risks.

To ensure accuracy, the team will double-check the results through independent verification, where separate team members re-examine key data sources and findings. Additionally, the results will undergo a peer review process within the team, ensuring multiple layers of scrutiny and validation. This rigorous approach ensures the reliability and reproducibility of the data analysis, maintaining high standards of due diligence.

You can also see a few example of press mention that our work has generated:  

### Intended venue for results publication and the timeline for publication

We plan to publish our report on our Crypto Aegis website (https://cryptoaegis.io/). We believe that two reports per month would be a good frequency of publication. 

### What your project is *not* or will *not* provide or implement

Our reports are not financial advice nor an insurance against risk. The advice and recommendations presented in the reports are neither a guarantee of future results on the part of Athena Intelligence SA, nor an insurance against risk. Indeed, our research and analysis represents Athena Intelligence SA's best judgement and is based solely on information that was publicly available at the time of writing. However, we insist that this is not financial advice and readers are invited to carry out their own research. 

## Ecosystem Fit

### Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

Crypto Aegis would mainly fit in the governance aspect of Polkadot, offering precise details about crypto projects, Parachains and Bridges for the whole ecosystem to make informed choices. This is turn, would also give full transparency on projects in the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

Our target audience is broad and inclusive, aimed at anyone involved in the crypto and blockchain space who is looking to avoid scams or being misled by shoddy projects. This includes individual investors who need reliable information to make informed decisions and avoid fraudulent projects. In addition, crypto-currency enthusiasts and community members can rely on our services to verify the legitimacy of projects they wish to support or participate in. Finally, our efforts extend to educating and protecting the general public, whether newcomers or experienced participants, from falling victim to scams or untrustworthy projects. By serving this wide range of users, Crypto Aegis aims to strengthen the overall security and integrity of the cryptographic ecosystem, promoting a safer environment for all stakeholde.

### What need(s) does your project meet?

In the blockchain industry, project backgrounds often lack transparency, creating opportunities for fraud and scams. Our services aim to counter this by providing clear insights into project backgrounds, enhancing transparency and mitigating risks. 

### Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  
To our knowledge, there is currently no project in the Substrate, Polkadot or Kusama ecosystems that offers a full due diligence service like Crypto Aegis. While there are many projects focused on security, auditing and providing various types of support for blockchain development, none seem to combine the detailed investigation approach and certification process that we provide.

Crypto Aegis stands out for its holistic and in-depth approach to due diligence. Our service goes beyond basic security audits by conducting in-depth investigations into a project's team, company history, assets, legal aspects, finances and reputation.

By addressing a broader spectrum of due diligence needs and integrating them into a single, cohesive service, Crypto Aegis fills a unique niche within the Substrate, Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, contributing to a more secure and trustworthy environment for all participants.
